# click-prediction
This project involves predicting clicks for on-line advertisements. The training data consists of data for 9 days from October 21, 2014 to October 29, 2014. There are in excess of 30 million records in this file. The performance criterion used to evaluate the performance of the prediction is log-loss. After EDA and FE, we basically used 6 predictive analytics methods to make predictions and chose the best one which is LightGBM to do final prediction on the test set.
